# Binary_Stellar_Animation
binary stellar evolution animation for both COMPAS and StarTrack
Usage Instruction:
This currently comes with an example COMPAS and StarTrack data file. If you would like to add your own instead, just add your data file to the folder, and change the path in the python script that corresponds to either COMPAS or StarTrack. This will also create a csv file with information just from the frames used for the animation; if you would like to run this in Blender, you should use these processed csv files. 


To run in blender instead, copy paste the .txt file into the "scripting" section of Blender. Press run on the code, and the animation should be created and visible in the layout section.

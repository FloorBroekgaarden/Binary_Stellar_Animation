# Binary_Stellar_Animation

This page contains the code and demo to create 3D visualization of the evolution of a binary system based on binary population synthesis output data. 
Currently this code has been tested to work for data with COMPAS and/or StarTrack. 


Usage Instruction:


This currently comes with an example COMPAS and StarTrack data file. If you would like to add your own instead, just add your data file to the folder, and change the path in the python script that corresponds to either COMPAS or StarTrack. 

This will also create a csv file with information just from the frames used for the animation; if you would like to run this in Blender, you should use these processed csv files. 


To run in blender instead, copy paste the .txt file into the "scripting" section of Blender. Press run on the code, and the animation should be created and visible in the layout section. 

All animations are created by Laya Binu. We are currently preparing a paper presenting this work. In the meantime you can cite this GitHub repository if you want to give credit to the author.
